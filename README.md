## About

In this app you can register a new account, login into your account and create and track any habit you want.
In the tab "Hoje" you can see the tracked habits for the current day.
In the tab "Hábitos" you can see the habits you created and can create and delete any habit you want.
In the tab "Histórico" you can see your progress in completing yout habits througth the month and can click on an specific day to see which habits you've completed or not in this day.

All data are stored in a public API.

I created this project with the aim of creating a usefull tool to help people keep their habits tracked in addition to challenging myself.
